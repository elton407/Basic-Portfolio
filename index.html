	<p>Hello my name is Elton Frederick. I was born and raised in Orlando so you can call me a native. I recently graduated form the University of Central Florida with a Bachelors of Science in Economics. What interested me in economics is the same thing that entertained me in web development: crital thinking.</p>


	<p>I hope that this portfolio will display the plethora of knowledge I hope to attain while attending this program. In my off time I enjoy watching movies, going to the gym, and drinking socially.I invite you to view my portfolio and hope you enjoy what you see! </p>
